    <h1>Open console log to see test results</h1>
    <p>For a grader viewing this:  All temp files are intended to be a testing platform.  They are a way for me to "show my work" and also serve as a way for me to isolate code and run it in a console.log to see the results in a controlled setting.  They are part of my completion of the challenge, but have no part of the final deployed product.</p>
